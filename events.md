# JavaScript Events

When running JavaScript in a browser, you get a lot of control and user
user interaction through the browser by way of events.



## The load event
The Load event fires when the browser is finished loading the HTML in a page
and associated content. In some cases, you'll want to wait until load fires to
run your scripts.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('load', function(){
  // Stuff to do on load goes here.
}
```
