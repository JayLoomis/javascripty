# Operators

What symbols to use for actions involving two things in JavaScipt.

## Mathematical operators

| Operator | Description                                                                             |
| :------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| +        | Adds the values of the expressions on either side. Overloaded for string concatenation. |
| -        | Subtracts the right expression from the left expression                                 |
| *        | Multiplies the values of the expressions on either side.                                |
| /        | Divides the value of the left expression by the value of the right expression.          |
| %        | As with division, except it equates to the resulting remainder.                         |
| **       | Raises the left expression to the power of the right expression.                        |
| ++       | Used with a single expression to increment it by one.                                   |
| --       | Used with a single expression to decrement it by one.                                   |
| -        | Used as a prefix to an expression to negate it (e.g. -(6 * 7) === -42).                 |
| +        | Used as a prefix to an expression to convert it into a number.                          |

## Assignment operators

| Operator | Description                                                 |
| :------: | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| =        | Assigns the value to the right to the variable on the left. |
| +=       | Adds (or concatenates) the value to the variable.           |
| -=       |                                                             |
| *=       |                                                             |
| /=       |                                                             |

## Comparison operators

| Operator | Description                                                 |
| :------: | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| <        | True if left is less than right.                            |
| >        | True if left is greater than right.                         |
| <=       | True if left is less than or equal to right.                |
| >=       | True if left is greater than or equal to right.             |
| ==       | Attempts to convert types to match, then true if equal.     |
| ===      | True if equal, no type conversion.                          |
| !=       | Attempts to convert types to match, then true if not equal. |
| !==      | True if not equal, no type conversion.                      |

## Boolean operators

| Operator | Description                                             |
| :------: | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\|\|`   |  OR&mdash;True if either is truthy.                     |
| `&&`     |  AND&mdash;True if both are truthy.                     |
| `!`      |  NOT&mdash;True is following argument is falsey.        |
