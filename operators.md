# Operators

What symbols to use for actions involving two things in JavaScipt.

## Mathematical operators

| Operator | Description                                                                             |
| :------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| +        | Adds the values of the expressions on either side. Overloaded for string concatenation. |
| -        | Subtracts the right expression from the left expression                                 |
| *        | Multiplies the values of the expressions on either side.                                |
| /        | Divides the value of the left expression by the value of the right expression.          |
| %        | As with division, except it equates to the resulting remainder.                         |
| **       | Raises the left expression to the power of the right expression.                        |
| ++       | Used with a single expression to increment it by one.                                   |
| --       | Used with a single expression to decrement it by one.                                   |
| -        | Used as a prefix to an expression to negate it (e.g. -(6 * 7) === -42).                 |
| +        | Used as a prefix to an expression to convert it into a number.                          |
